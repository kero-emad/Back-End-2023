                                      API (Application Programming Interface)
At first,I want to mention one of the uses of the API which we find repeated in our daily lives to clarify an initial idea of how the API works
- while using Application (UBER) or any app for delivery we use google maps to access our location
In this case Google Maps offers these applications its own API to access the location
- Any Website or Application dealing with file management system to upload files 

How API works ??? 
To know how the API works we want to know how the websites works in the traditional way without API 
As shown in figure 1
1-The client request to get the website to the server (Request)
2-The server asks to get the data from the database
3-The database send data to the server
4-The server fill the data into HTML file 
5-The server sends this HTML file to the browser (Response)
6-The browser converts the HTML codes to visual format to the user
By using this way The codes of Frontend(HTML+css+JS) and backend (Python+postgress) in one project Which are known as linked sites
This is another method (How the websites work) dependent on API
In this way The client does not deal with the server directly but by using API
As shown in figure 2
1-The client sends API request to the server  
2-The server asks to get the data from the database
3-The database send data to the server
4-The server collect the data and build API
5-The server sends API to the browser (Response)
6-The browser read the API (data only) and converts it to visual format to the user
By using this way The codes of frontend and backend don't be gathered in one project which are known as separate sites

A simple classification of APIs
web service APIs : Soap,REST
Library Based APIs : Javascript,TWAIN
Class based APIs : Java API,Android API
OS functions and routines : Access to file system,Access to user interface
Object remoting APIs : CORBA,.Net Remoting
Hardware APIs: Hard disk drives,PCI buses

We will get to know the REST APIs but before that we should know about HTTP protocal and HTTP methods

                                               HTTP Protocol
It depends on Request,Response 
As shown in figure 3
- The client make a request to deal with data through HTTP protocol by using HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE)
- The Database server sends a response which is usually a JSON (Java script object notation) : an easy formula to represent data which consists of a value and a key

HTTP methods
GET:retrive an existing resource
POST: create a new resource
PUT:Update an existing resource
Patch: partially update an existing resource
Delete:Delete a resource 

Note:: Web service is an API, but in order for it to work, it needs the HTTP protocol and Network, so we can say that every web service is an API, and not every API is a web service

                                    REST (REpresentation State Transfer) APIs
- Depends on client-server protocol (ex:HTTP)
- Transfer Server objects as resources
- It uses HTTP methods to get data from Database Server

1)GET method
import requests
api_url='.............'
response=requests.get(api_url)
print(response.json())

2)POST method
import requests
api_url='.............'
new={"ID":258,"name":kerolos)
response=requests.post(api_url,json=new)
print(response.json())

3)PUT method
import requests
api_url='.............'
response=requests.get(api_url)
print(response.json())
new={"ID":258,"name":Ali)
response=requests.put(api_url,json=new)
print(response.json())

4)PATCH method
import requests
api_url='.............'
response=requests.get(api_url)
print(response.json())
new={"name":Ahmed)
response=requests.patch(api_url,json=new)
print(response.json())

5)Delete method
import requests
api_url='.............'
response=requests.delete(api_url)
print(response.json())
